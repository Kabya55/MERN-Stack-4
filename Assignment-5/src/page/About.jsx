      <p className="mb-4">
        Welcome to our simple React E-commerce store! This project is built as a
        frontend-only demo to showcase core e-commerce functionality such as
        product listing, product details, cart management, and routing â€” all
        without a backend.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The application is developed using <strong>React</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>React Router</strong>, with cart state management handled by{" "}
        <strong>React Context API</strong>. It focuses on clean design, smooth
        navigation, and a responsive layout to ensure a user-friendly experience
        across devices.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This store is for educational and demonstration purposes only. No real
        transactions or user accounts are involved.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
        Thank you for visiting our store demo. Happy coding!
